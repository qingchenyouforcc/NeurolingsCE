```

3. Build.

### Windows

A Docker image is provided to build Shijima-Qt.

```

## Platform Notes

### macOS

Shijima-Qt needs the Accessibility permission to access the frontmost window.

### Linux

Shijima-Qt supports KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME 46 in both Wayland and X11. To get the frontmost window, Shijima-Qt automatically installs and enables a shell plugin when started.  
- On KDE, this is transparent to the user.
- On GNOME, the shell needs to be restarted on the first run. This can be done by logging out and logging back in. Shijima-Qt will exit with an appropriate error message if this is required.
- On other desktop environments, window tracking will not be available.

### Windows

Only tested on Windows 11. May also work on Windows 10. Window tracking is supported and no extra actions should be necessary to run Shijima-Qt.
